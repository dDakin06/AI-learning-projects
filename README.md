 AI Learning Projects
This repository contains my AI experiments implemented in Python, showcasing core machine learning and reinforcement learning concepts and helping me during my learning:

1) Linear Regression
A basic implementation of linear regression from scratch using NumPy, demonstrating:

Gradient descent for minimizing mean squared error (MSE)

Predicting continuous values from a 1D dataset

2) Simple Neural Network – XOR Problem
A feedforward neural network built without external libraries to solve the classic XOR classification task:

Implements ReLU and sigmoid activations

Uses backpropagation and manual weight updates

 3) Reinforcement Learning – Frozen Lake Agent
A Q-learning agent trained to solve the FrozenLake environment using Gymnasium:

Implements an epsilon-greedy policy

Learns a state-action value function (Q-table)

Demonstrates environment interaction, learning through trial and error
